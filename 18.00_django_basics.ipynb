    "Django is popular **'web framework'**: a set of tools designed for building interactive web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up a project\n",
    "1. describe the project’s goals in a specification, or *spec*\n",
    "2. Once you have a clear set of goals, you can start to identify manageable tasks to achieve those goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing a spec\n",
    "We’ll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to:\n",
    "- log the topics they’re interested ii\n",
    "- make journal entries as they learn about each topic\n",
    "\n",
    "The Learning Log home page will:\n",
    "- describe the site\n",
    "- invite users to either register or log in\n",
    "\n",
    "Once logged in a user can:\n",
    "- create new topics\n",
    "- add new entries\n",
    "- read and edit existing entries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create and activate new virtual environment\n",
    "Separating one project’s libraries from other projects is beneficial and **!!will be necessary!!** when we deploy the project to a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Project in Django\n",
    "With .venv active, enter the following command in a command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ django-admin startproject `project_name` .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**!!Don’t forget this dot (.) at the end!!** of the above command, or you might run into some configuration issues when you deploy the app. If you forget the dot, delete the files and folders that were created (except `project-name`) and run the command again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command creates:\n",
    "- **´project-name` directory** with some files inside. Most important are:\n",
    "    - settings.py: controls how Django interacts with your system and manages your project\n",
    "    - urls.py: tells Django which pages to build in response to browser requests\n",
    "    - wsgi.py: helps Django serve the files it creates (acronym for “web server gateway interface.”)\n",
    "- **manage.py**\n",
    "    - a short program that takes in commands and feeds them to the relevant part of Django\n",
    "    - these commands manage the tasks, such as working with databases and running servers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the Database\n",
    "Django stores most of the information for a project in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "With .venv active, enter the following command in a command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ python manage.py migrate\n",
    "```\n",
    "Anytime we modify a database, we say we’re *migrating* the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time we run this command in a new project using SQLite, Django will:\n",
    "- create a new database for us to store information it needs to handle administrative and authentication tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite is a database that runs off a single file:\n",
    "- it’s ideal for writing simple apps\n",
    "- you don’t have to pay much attention to managing the database\n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing the project\n",
    "\n",
    "To view the project in the current state, enter the following command in a command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py runserver\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Django starts a the development server, so you can view the project on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can view the project by entering the following url in a browser:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://127.0.0.1:8000/\n",
    "\n",
    "The above URL indicates that the project is listening for requests on port 8000 on your computer, which is called a localhost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term localhost refers to a server that only processes requests on your system; it doesn’t allow anyone else to see the pages you’re developing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stop 'localserver'\n",
    "When you want to stop the server, press **'CTRL-C'** in the terminal where the runserver command was issued and close the browser window.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Troubleshoot: “That port is already in use”:\n",
    "Use different port like 8001, 8002, 8003... with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python manage.py runserver 8001\n",
    "```"
